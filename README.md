## what is it
this is a project I made to learn how to get a better understanding of passing props and using socket io to connect multiple users to a server.
it uses a custom hook "useLocalStorage" to to persist data in so on refresh you dont loose your progress.
in event of an error in development called a cross origin error, clear local storage and refresh page.
